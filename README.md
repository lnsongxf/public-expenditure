# Jupyter Notebook: Public Expenditure

## Overview

This [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org) computes the optimal level of public expenditure in a simple business-cycle matching model. 

## Model and simulations

The model features self-employed workers who sell their services on a matching market to other households and the government. 

The notebook calibrates the model to US data. The notebook simulates the model in response to aggregate-demand shocks and aggregate-supply shocks. 

The notebook then computes the optimal stimulus spending in response to these shocks.

## How to use the notebook

The notebook can be accessed on this [page](https://pascalmichaillat.github.io/public-expenditure/docs/notebook.html). The notebook allows users to modify data sources, parameters values, functional forms, and recompute optimal stimulus pending over the business cycle.
