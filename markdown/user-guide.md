# A Quick User Guide

Before you start reading the book, here is a quick walkthrough of how this book works and how you can make the most out of it.

## How the Book Works

This is an executable Jupyter book. Many sections of this book are written in Jupyter Notebook format, which means they are a combination of code and markdown renderings. This book not only shows how optimal policies are calculated, but also allow you to experiment how these policies change under different macroeconomic environments.

## How to Run the Code

The notebooks can be executed online through `Binder`. What `Binder` does essentially is to host the notebooks on servers, and allow users to execute code chunks without having to download the notebooks and run them locally. To run the code online, simply click the `Binder` badge on the top right of each section.

## Where Users Can Find the Source Code

The source code is hosted [here](https://github.com/pascalmichaillat/public-expenditure). The notebooks are under the `notebooks` folder. 

## How Users Can Build on the Book
