# A Quick User Guide

```{Welcome!}
Welcome to our executable book! Before you start reading the book, here is a quick walkthrough of the structure of this book and how to use it. Hope this can help you make the most out of it.
```

## How the Book Works

This is an executable Jupyter book. Most sections of this book are written in Jupyter Notebook, which means they are a combination of code and markdown cells. This book not only shows how optimal policies are calculated, but also allows users to interact with our policy functions and see how they change under different macroeconomic environments by changing the inputs yourself.

## How to Run the Code

You can execute the notebooks online via `Binder`. What Binder does is hosting the notebooks on servers. This allows users to execute notebooks without having to download them and run them locally. 
t
To run the code online, simply click on the ![rocket](../images/rocket_logo.png) button on the top right of each Jupyter Notebook section. Note that you won't see this icon for certain pages if they are not rendered from Jupyter Notebook.

Under the rocket button, there are two options:

- The first one says **Binder**. and the second one says **Live Code**, which launches a new page for you to run the code when clicked on.

- The second option says **Live Code**, which turns the current page into an interactive environment by using [Thebe](https://thebe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Both options creates a remote kernel on `Binder`, which allows you to modify the code and see how output changes accordingly. 

## Where the Source Code is Stored

The source code is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/pascalmichaillat/public-expenditure). 

You can also go to the Github repo by clicking the **repository** option  under the ![github](../images/github_logo.png) icon on the top right of the page. 

If you find something wrong with the code, or are confused about certain implementations, you can also raise an issue by clicking the **open issue** button. 

Once you are in the repo, you can find the notebooks in the [here](../notebooks) folder. Output produced by the notebooks are stored [here](../notebooks/output/).

## How to Download Data Generated by the Notebooks

It might be useful for you to change the inputs of the model using our interactive tools and download the new set of policy recommendations. Fortunately, Binder allows us to do that. You can download outputs of the model by following these steps: 

1. Click on the **Binder** option  under the ![rocket](../images/rocket_logo.png) button. 
1. Run the notebooks with the Binder kernel, modify the parameters you want tochange, and write your output onto your binder kernel in your desired format. We will put in place code segments that help you store your outputs, but feel free to change them to suit your needs. 
1. After you write the outputs in Binder, click on the `Jupyter` logo on the top left corner of your Binder page. This redirects you to the file directory. You can now find the newly created output files under the output directory that you set and download them onto your computer!

## Where the Functions are Defined

Since we use one notebook for each section, and there are functions used by multiple notebooks, we decided to put all our reusable functions in the [Helper Functions](../notebooks/helpers) section. This section defines all the functions used in the chapter, and provides detailed documentation and references of how each function works.
