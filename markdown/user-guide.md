# A Quick User Guide

Before you start reading the book, here is a quick walkthrough of the structure of this book. Hope this can help you make the most out of it.

## How the Book Works

This is an executable Jupyter book. Most sections of this book are written in Jupyter Notebook, which means they are a combination of code and markdown cells. This book not only shows how optimal policies are calculated, but also allows users to interact with our policy functions and see how they change under different macroeconomic environments by changing the inputs yourself.

## How to Run the Code

You can execute the notebooks online via `Binder`. What `Binder` does is hosting the notebooks on servers. This allows users to execute notebooks without having to download them and run them locally. To run the code online, simply click the `Binder` badge on the top right of each Jupyter Notebook section.

## Where the Source Code is Stored

The source code is hosted [here](https://github.com/pascalmichaillat/public-expenditure). You can also go to the Github repo by clicking the Github icon on the top right of the page. 

In the repo, the notebooks are in the `notebooks` folder. Output produced by the notebooks are stored in `notebooks/output/`.

## Where the Functions are Defined

Since we use one notebook for each section, and there are functions used by multiple notebooks, we decided to put all our reusable functions in the `Helper Functions` section. This section defines all the functions used in the chapter, and provides detailed documentation and references of how each function works.
