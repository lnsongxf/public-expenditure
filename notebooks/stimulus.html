<p>We want to find out what the optimal stimulus is for any deviation from the steady state. Here, we set <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(u_0 = 9\%\)</span>, which means we want to calculate the optimal stimulus when current unemployment rate is around <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3\)</span> percentage points higher than the steady-state value. Feel free to change this value to see how optimal stimulus changes.</p>
<p>We also set <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\eta = 0.6\)</span> and calculate <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(m\)</span>’s for a given range of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M\)</span>’s:</p>

<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{g/c - (g/c)^*}{(g/c)^*} \approx \frac{z_0 \epsilon m}{1 + z_1 z_0\epsilon m^2}\cdot \frac{u_0 - \bar{u}}{\bar{u}}.\)</span>          <a class="reference external" href="https://www.pascalmichaillat.org/6.html"><img alt="Generic badge" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/MS19-Eq%2023-purple?logo=read-the-docs" /></a></p>
