# Optimal Public Expenditure over the Business Cycle

This [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) computes the optimal level of public expenditure in a simple matching model of the business cycle. 

The model features self-employed workers who sell their services on a matching market to other households and the government. 

The notebook calibrates the model to US data. The notebook simulates the model in response to aggregate-demand shocks and aggregate-supply shocks. 

The notebook then computes the optimal stimulus spending in response to these shocks.

## How to use the notebook

The notebook is `public-expenditure.ipynb`, available in this repository. Through [Binder](https://mybinder.org), the notebook allows users to modify data sources, parameters values, functional forms, and recompute optimal stimulus pending over the business cycle.
