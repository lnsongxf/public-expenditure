# A Quick User Guide

Before you start reading the book, here is a quick walkthrough of the structure of this book. Hope this can help you make the most out of it.

## How the Book Works

This is an executable Jupyter book. Most sections of this book are written in the Jupyter Notebook format, which means they are a combination of code and markdown renderings. This book not only shows how optimal policies are calculated, but also allow you to experiment how these policies change under different macroeconomic environments by changing the inputs yourself.

## How to Run the Code

You can execute the notebooks online through `Binder`. What `Binder` does is hosting the notebooks on servers, which allows users to execute code chunks without having to download the notebooks and run them locally. To run the code online, simply click the `Binder` badge on the top right of each Jupyter Notebook section.

## Where Users Can Find the Source Code

The source code is hosted [here](https://github.com/pascalmichaillat/public-expenditure). The notebooks are under the `notebooks` folder. 

## Where are the Functions Defined?

Since we use one notebook for each section, and there are functions used by multiple notebooks, we decided to put all our reusable functions in the `Helper Functions` section. This section defines all the functions used in the chapter, and provides detailed documentation and references of how each function works. 

## How Users Can Build on the Book

If you want to continue building on the book, you can simply fork the Github repository and make edits in your fork.
