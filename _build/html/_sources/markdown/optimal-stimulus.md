# Optimal Public Expenditure over the Business Cycle

This chapter computes the optimal level of public expenditure in a simple matching model of the business cycle. The model features self-employed workers who sell their services on a matching market to other households and the government. 

In this chapter, we first calibrate the parameters using US data. We then show how to compute optimal stimulus with the sufficient-statistics formula in Michaillat and Saez (2019) to see how optimal stimulus varies with different parameter values. We then calibrate the rest of the paramters needed for the business cycle simulations. Finally, we simulate business cycles with aggregate-demand shocks and compute the optimal stimulus spending in response to these shocks.
